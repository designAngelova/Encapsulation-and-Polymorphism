Shapes
Define an interface IShape with two abstract methods: CalculateArea() and CalculatePerimeter().
Define an abstract class BasicShape implementing IShape and holding width and height. Leave the methods CalculateArea() and CalculatePerimeter() abstract.
Define two new BasicShape subclasses: Triangle and Rectangle that implement the abstract methods CalculateArea() and CalculatePerimeter().
Define a class Circle with a suitable constructor and IShape.
Create an array of different shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) and test the behavior of the CalculateSurface() and CalculatePerimeter() methods.
